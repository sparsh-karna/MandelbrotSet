# MandelbrotSet

This repository implements the algorithm of the Mandelbrot set to create both static and dynamic representations of the set on a complex plane.

## Significance of the Mandelbrot Set

The Mandelbrot set is a famous fractal named after the mathematician BenoÃ®t B. Mandelbrot. It is a set of complex numbers that produces a distinctive, infinitely complex boundary when plotted. The set is defined by iterating the function:

\[ f_c(z) = z^2 + c \]

where \( z \) starts at zero and \( c \) is a complex parameter. The Mandelbrot set includes all values of \( c \) for which the orbit of \( z \) does not escape to infinity.

### Key Properties

- **Self-Similarity**: The boundary of the Mandelbrot set exhibits self-similarity at different scales, meaning smaller portions of the boundary resemble the whole set.
- **Complexity from Simplicity**: Despite being generated from a simple iterative process, the Mandelbrot set produces highly intricate and beautiful patterns.
- **Connection to Julia Sets**: Each point in the Mandelbrot set corresponds to a specific Julia set, another type of fractal.

## Mathematical Calculation

To determine if a complex number \( c \) is in the Mandelbrot set, we iterate the function \( f_c(z) = z^2 + c \) starting with \( z = 0 \). The number \( c \) is part of the Mandelbrot set if the absolute value of \( z \) remains bounded (does not go to infinity) after many iterations. Typically, the following steps are used:

1. Initialize \( z = 0 \).
2. Iterate the function \( z = z^2 + c \).
3. Check if \( |z| > 2 \) (if so, \( c \) is not in the Mandelbrot set).
4. Repeat for a maximum number of iterations or until \( |z| \) exceeds 2.

The number of iterations before \( z \) exceeds 2 can be used to color the point \( c \), creating a visual representation of the set.

## Features

- **Static Representation**: Generates a static image of the Mandelbrot set.
- **Dynamic Representation**: Creates an animated visualization of the Mandelbrot set's iterative process.
